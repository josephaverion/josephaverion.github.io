## Why Software Engineering?

Making things has always been a part of my interest. When I heard about applications at a young age, I wondered how they worked. Exploring these interests led me to discover programming. Programming offers me endless possibilities to create what I want. With each line of code I write, I find myself on a path of continuous learning and self-discovery. There are an abundant amount of technologies out there that I can interact with, modify, and or create using coding.

Programming is also a huge part of society these days. Almost everything utilizes some sort of application or website to manage. Programming is also growing every day with computer scientists finding or creating new ways to do things in this industry. I also hope to participate in this growth.

## Training my Intuition
The competition for software engineering jobs is high since computer science is advertised a lot. I aim to get into a few internships in my later years of college for a great chance to land a job right after I graduate. To get into these internships pretty much all companies require you to go through a nerve-racking coding interview. Solving coding problems is the key to acing the interviews. I want to have as many procedures and methods to solve these problems as intuition so I can feel confident in interviews. I’ve been doing this already through Leetcode and in my ICS 314 class we have WODs which are also timed coding problems.

## Software vs. Web Development Decision
I’m still deciding whether I should focus on web or software development for front-end development. So far I have used the Swing framework to build GUIs in Java, and currently learning JavaScript with meteor to build websites. I enjoy doing both of them, but there are many software engineering positions out there that have you focus on one. Many companies need one or the other, so there’s really no harm in choosing one over the other. Furthermore with a higher skill set I will have more opportunities. I guess as time passes by we’ll see which field I want to end up leaning more to.
