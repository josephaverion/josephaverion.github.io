## Introduction

The integration of AI into education, especially in Software Engineering, has transformed the way we learn. It can provide an answer from its knowledge base by simply typing anything to the search bar. Well, AI is basically an algorithm, it doesn’t actually know the knowledge you are asking. With this in mind, AI can be right or wrong. I feel like if you simply use AI to hope it will give you an answer that is not the way to go about it. You should always assume AI is wrong, and to use AI as an assistant, not something to rely on.


## AI In The classroom.

I was surprised when my professor for my ICS 314 class encouraged us to use AI for the class. It was my first time hearing that since all my other classes were saying that AI is strictly not allowed. The AI services I used in this class was ChatGPT and Phind.

## AI for WODS

I did not use AI to experience WODs or in class practice WODs because I wanted to try to learn the material by myself as much as possible. Additionally the screencasts provided me enough information for me to solve them. However, for in-class WODS, when I got stuck I used AI as it was better than google searching. The AI I was using was Phind, an AI that uses the GPT 4 model for free, and uses the internet for its answers.

## Essays

As someone whose writing is not the best, I used AI to help with it. However, I am able to brain dump a lot of ideas on a paper, writing without stopping. This ends up with sentences that don't 100% make sense, since I’m not worrying about sentence structure or grammar when writing them down. Then I put my sloppy essay into Ai and ask it how I can make it better and flow better. Furthermore, if I cannot think of anything to write, I ask an AI on topics of what I can write, and it can help me formulate ideas to start. I don’t like using AI to write papers for me, I like using it for idea starters and improving on my writing.

## Final Project

I turned to AI during my final project on concepts I don’t understand. In this project there are a lot of new components or new things we create that aren’t replicated in screencasts. Sometimes I lack the energy to google search so I just resort to using phind. I rarely use chatgpt for coding because I have the free version which has GPT 3.5. As I mentioned earlier, Phind uses the GPT 4 model which is much better.


## Asking/Answer Questions

If I was actively working with someone I know that is online at the moment I would ask them, but if I don't want to wait for a response I would just ask AI. For answering questions I never really answered the ones in discord, but I believe I would have probably used AI if I didn’t know the answer to their question.

## Coding Example

I asked AI for examples for underscore functions one time because the ones in the documentation were kind of confusing to me. One of the ones I asked was “give me examples of how maps can be used”.

## Explaining Code

There were many times I was confused about a piece of code. If I couldn’t find it through a google search or the screencast, or I didn’t feel like doing that, I would resort to asking AI.

## Writing Code

I only used AI for writing code if I already tried multiple times. I don’t want to waste several hours on part of the code when I can use AI. I feel like I can justify using AI once I try many solutions. Furthermore, when the AI does generate the code I try to understand it before I paste it.

## Documenting Code

I used AI for helping me word terms in documentation, but I try to write most of it myself because I can gain a better understanding if I do so.

## Quality assurance

Similar to writing code, I would only use AI when I already tried several solutions to fix the problem myself. A common problem I would have is the whole page not rendering because a component breaks. First I would try to look through the console and code and after about 30+ minutes if I still can’t find it I will provide my code in the areas I think the error occurred and ask it to debug it.


## Impact on Learning and Understanding

Incorporating AI into my software engineering education accelerated skill development, especially in coding. AI tools acted as collaborative partners, giving me useful information if I couldn’t understand it. However, I feel like if the problem was too complex they gave wrong directions, so it’s best to always believe AI may be wrong.

## Practical Applications

For practical usages, I have used AI to help draft me a 1000 word application. I have written most of myself but sometimes I couldn't think of any more things to write or didn’t know how to elongate ideas. AI helped me with these roadblocks quite easily and I ended up writing great applications that help me get accepted

## Challenges and Opportunities

One of the challenges I faced using AI was having a hard time understanding the code it sent. The code sometimes wouldn’t line up with other parts of the codebase especially when trying to make it code someone for a big project.

## Future Considerations

I will continue to use AI as an assistant, asking it more about suggestions and explaining stuff rather than relying on it. Additionally I will always keep in mind it will probably be wrong especially for stuff with a lot of context needed.

## Conclusion

Concluding on how AI is used in learning software engineering, it's been a big change. AI makes learning more interesting and helps us get better at it, but can hinder us if we rely too much on it. As it evolves it will continue to change how we learn.
